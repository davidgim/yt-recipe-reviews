# YouTube Recipe Reviews
Author: David Gim

Overview:

YouTube Recipe Reviews allows individuals to query for YouTube video recipes directly on this webapp, and view public user-created
reviewws for that video, while also being able to leave their own reviews through user registration.

Background:

With cooking becoming a hobby of mine, I would always scavenge YouTube to find the best recipes to try and make next. I found that
there was often no easy way to find reviews of these video recipes themselves. Oftentimes, the metrics such as likes and positive comments
corresponded more to the quality of the video/creator rather than the recipe itself. Thus, I wanted a platform purely for home cooks to be 
able to leave reviews on the actual recipe itself.

Stack Used: 

Springboot
MongoDB
React

Why this tech stack?:

As I have been learning full stack development, Node JS was often the most used backend software used. However, as someone who 
has had the most experience in Java I wanted to gain experience utilizing Java to incorporate into a full-stack project, thus
chose Springboot to create the backend. I chose MongoDB because I appreciate the ease of setup with MongoDB Atlas as well as
the flexible schemas for my objects. Additionally, as I needed to make changes to my schemas as I developed the project, MongoDB's
flexibility made that easier. I chose React because with implementing my own authentication with spring security in the backend, 
I had more experience with managing things like auth slices and state management in react with using redux.
